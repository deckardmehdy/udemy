# Projects
Hi everyone! As of September 2019, I have been doing a Full Stack Web Developer bootcamp on Udemy. Here are some of the projects that I created during my bootcamp:
* **Color Game**: This game was created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It's an interactive game that tests a player's knowledge of RGB values. An RGB value is as RGB(red, blue, green). Each parameter defines the intensity of the respective color as an integer between 0 and 255, where 255 is the maximum intensity. To play, you select a square that you think has a color matching the RGB value posted at the top of the page. Also, you can play in easy or hard mode. Easy mode means that there are 3 squares to choose from whereas with hard mode you select from 6 squares.
